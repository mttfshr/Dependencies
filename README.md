Dependencies
============
The central experiment behind Dependencies is whether you can create a workflow that mirrors a way that real-world social credibility and standing is built.

An example: in many creative industries people are willing to 'pay it forward' for other creatives, lending help and doing favors for a complex set of motives, two of which are that it feels good and that thre may be an occasion to reciprocate the help.

Can you set up an editorial workflow with just this concept as the organizing principle?
